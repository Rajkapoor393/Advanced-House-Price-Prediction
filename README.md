# Advanced-House-Price-Prediction

### Building Machine Learning Pipelines: Data Analysis Phase 
Here we will focus on creating Machine Learning Pipelines considering all the life cycle of a Data Science Projects. This will be important for professionals who have not worked with huge dataset.

### Project Name: House Prices: Advanced Regression Techinques
The aim of this project is to predict the house price based on various features which we will discuss as we go ahead.

#### Dataset to downloaded from the belos link

### All the Lifecycle In A Data Science Projects

1. Data Analysis
2. Feature Engineering
3. Feature Selection
4. Model Building
5. Model Deployment

###  In Data Analysis 
we will analyze to find out the below stuff

1. Missing Values
2. All The Numerical Variables
3. Distribution of the Numerical Variables
4. Categorical Variables
5. Cardinality of Categorical Variables
6. Outliers
7. Relationship between independent and dependent feature(SalePrice)

### Feature Engineering

1. Missing Values
2. Temporal Variables
3. Categorical Variables: remove rare labels
4. Standarise the value of the Variables to the same range
